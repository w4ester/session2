Subject: Session 2 Workshop Tomorrow: Build Your LinkedIn Post GPT (40 min)

Hi Todd, Neil, Carol, and Mo,

Quick heads-up for tomorrow's workshop! We're building a LinkedIn Post GPT together in 40 minutes.

WORKSHOP LINK: https://w4ester.github.io/session2/

WHAT WE'RE BUILDING:
A Custom GPT that writes LinkedIn posts in your voice and actually posts them to LinkedIn for you. Idea to published post in 2 minutes.

WHAT YOU'LL NEED:
✅ ChatGPT Plus account ($20/month) - Required
✅ Laptop ready to code along
✅ LinkedIn account (we'll post live!)

PRE-WORKSHOP CHECKLIST:
Before the session, please:
1. Verify ChatGPT Plus access: https://chatgpt.com/gpts/editor
2. Have 2-3 past LinkedIn posts ready (optional)
3. Dual monitors recommended (slides + GPT Editor)

SESSION FORMAT:
This is fully hands-on - NOT a lecture. Everyone opens GPT Editor and builds together. I'll walk through each step, you follow along.

Don't have ChatGPT Plus yet? No problem - take notes and build later with the guide.

TIME: [ADD YOUR MEETING TIME]
