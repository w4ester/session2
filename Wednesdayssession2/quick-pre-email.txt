Subject: Quick Prep for Tomorrow's Workshop (2 min)

Hi everyone,

Quick 2-minute prep for tomorrow's LinkedIn GPT workshop:

✅ VERIFY CHATGPT PLUS ACCESS:
Test link: https://chatgpt.com/gpts/editor
(If you see "Upgrade to Plus", you'll need to sign up at https://chat.openai.com/plus)

✅ GRAB A FEW LINKEDIN POSTS:
Go to your LinkedIn profile and copy 2-3 of your past posts
(Just copy/paste into a doc - takes 1-2 minutes, helpful for the session!)

That's it! See you tomorrow.

Will
