# Company Values

These core values should be woven into all executive communications. Use them as guiding principles when drafting messages.

## Our Core Values

### 1. Customer Obsession
**What it means:** We exist to solve customer problems, not to build cool technology. Every decision starts with "How does this help our customers succeed?"

**In practice:**
- We measure success by customer outcomes, not just our revenue
- We over-communicate with customers, especially when things go wrong
- We build features customers need, not features we think are cool

**How to reference in communications:**
- "This feature came directly from customer feedback..."
- "Our customers told us they needed..."
- "We're obsessed with helping you succeed..."

---

### 2. Radical Transparency
**What it means:** We share information openly—the good, the bad, and the uncertain. We trust our team with the truth.

**In practice:**
- We share financial metrics with the entire company
- We admit mistakes publicly and quickly
- We explain the "why" behind decisions, not just the "what"

**How to reference in communications:**
- "I want to be transparent about the challenges we're facing..."
- "Here's what we know, what we don't know, and what we're doing..."
- "Let me share the full context..."

---

### 3. Bias to Action
**What it means:** We move fast, learn fast, and adjust. We'd rather make a decision and course-correct than wait for perfect information.

**In practice:**
- We ship MVPs and iterate based on feedback
- We make decisions at 70% confidence, not 100%
- We celebrate "fast failures" that teach us something

**How to reference in communications:**
- "We're moving quickly on this..."
- "We'll start with a pilot and adjust based on what we learn..."
- "This is our first attempt—we'll refine as we go..."

---

### 4. Own the Outcome
**What it means:** We take responsibility for results, not just effort. No excuses, no blame. If something fails, we fix it.

**In practice:**
- We don't blame external factors (market, competition, bad luck)
- We focus on what we can control
- We hold ourselves accountable to commitments

**How to reference in communications:**
- "This is on us to fix..."
- "We own this outcome..."
- "Here's what we're doing differently..."

---

### 5. Build for the Long Term
**What it means:** We make decisions that set us up for sustainable success, not short-term wins that create long-term problems.

**In practice:**
- We invest in quality, even when shortcuts are tempting
- We build a culture that scales
- We prioritize customer lifetime value over quick revenue

**How to reference in communications:**
- "This positions us for long-term success..."
- "We're playing the long game here..."
- "Short-term pain, long-term gain..."

## Using Values in Communications

### When to explicitly reference values:
- Explaining difficult decisions
- Recognizing team members who exemplify a value
- Clarifying strategy or priorities
- Setting expectations for behavior

### When to embody values without naming them:
- Most day-to-day communications
- Let the values show through actions and tone, not just words

### Examples:

**Explicitly naming values:**
> "This pivot embodies our bias to action—we saw the data, made the call, and we're moving. If we're wrong, we'll own that outcome and adjust quickly."

**Embodying values without naming:**
> "I want to share the full financial picture, including where we're behind plan. Here's what we're doing about it..."
> (This demonstrates radical transparency without saying "radical transparency")

## Anti-Values (What We're Not)

It's equally important to know what we don't value:

**❌ Consensus-driven** - We seek input, but we don't wait for everyone to agree before moving
**❌ Perfection-obsessed** - We ship good enough and iterate, rather than waiting for perfect
**❌ Blame culture** - We focus on fixing problems, not finding scapegoats
**❌ Politics** - We reward results and values alignment, not office politics
**❌ Hustle culture** - We work smart and sustainably, not performatively long hours

## Tone Implications

Our values shape HOW we communicate:

**Because we value transparency:**
- We don't sugarcoat bad news
- We share context, not just directives
- We admit what we don't know

**Because we value bias to action:**
- We're decisive in tone (not wishy-washy)
- We focus on next steps, not endless analysis
- We acknowledge imperfect information

**Because we value ownership:**
- We use "we" and "I," never "they"
- We focus on solutions, not blame
- We make commitments and follow through

**Because we're customer-obsessed:**
- We tie decisions back to customer impact
- We celebrate customer wins as our wins
- We listen more than we talk

**Because we build for the long term:**
- We explain the strategic rationale
- We don't promise overnight success
- We invest in relationships, not just transactions
