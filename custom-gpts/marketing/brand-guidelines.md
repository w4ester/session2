## Writing Style Guidelines

### General Principles

**Use active voice:**
- ✅ "Automate your campaigns"
- ❌ "Campaigns can be automated"

**Write for skimmers:**
- Break up long paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Use bullet points liberally
- Bold key takeaways
- Add descriptive subheadings

**Lead with benefits, not features:**
- ✅ "Save 5 hours per week on campaign setup"
- ❌ "Advanced automation engine with scheduling capabilities"

**Use specific numbers:**
- ✅ "3x better conversion rates"
- ❌ "Significantly improved performance"

**Avoid jargon and buzzwords:**
- ❌ "Leverage synergies" → ✅ "Work together more effectively"
- ❌ "Best-in-class solution" → ✅ "92% of customers still use it after 6 months"
- ❌ "Revolutionary AI" → ✅ "AI that saves you 5 hours per week"

### Sentence Structure

**Keep sentences short:**
- Aim for 15-20 words per sentence
- Break complex ideas into multiple sentences
- One idea per sentence

**Vary sentence length:**
- Mix short punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones
- Create rhythm: short, medium, short, longer, short

**Use contractions naturally:**
- ✅ "You're" not "You are"
- ✅ "We'll" not "We will"
- ✅ "Don't" not "Do not"

### Word Choice

**Prefer simple words:**
- "Use" not "utilize"
- "Help" not "facilitate"
- "Buy" not "purchase"
- "Show" not "demonstrate"

**Use power words sparingly:**
- Save them for moments that matter
- Don't overuse: Amazing, Revolutionary, Game-changing
- Better alternatives: Proven, Measurable, Practical

**Be inclusive:**
- Use "they" instead of "he/she"
- "Team members" not "guys"
- "People" not "users" (when referring to customers)

---

## Messaging Frameworks

### Value Proposition Formula

**Structure:** [Outcome] + [Timeframe] + [Differentiator]

**Example:**
"Marketing automation that delivers ROI in weeks, not months—so your team can focus on strategy, not execution."

**Components:**
- Outcome: ROI
- Timeframe: weeks, not months
- Differentiator: focus on strategy vs execution

### Feature → Benefit Translation

**Pattern:** [Feature] → [So that] → [Benefit]

**Example:**
- Feature: "AI-powered campaign optimization"
- So that: "You don't have to manually A/B test and adjust"
- Benefit: "Save 5+ hours per week and get 3x better results"

**Usage in marketing:**
"Our AI optimizes campaigns automatically—so you don't waste time on manual A/B testing—freeing up 5+ hours per week for strategic work."

### Call-to-Action Hierarchy

**Primary CTA (High Intent):**
- "Start Free Trial"
- "Book a Demo"
- "See How It Works"
- Bold, high contrast, prominent placement

**Secondary CTA (Low Intent):**
- "Learn More"
- "Watch Video"
- "Download Guide"
- Outlined button, less prominent

**Tertiary CTA (Alternative):**
- "View Pricing"
- "Read Case Studies"
- "Contact Sales"
- Text link, minimal styling

## Content Guidelines by Asset Type

### Landing Pages

**Hero Section:**
- Headline (7-10 words): State the main benefit
- Subheadline (15-25 words): Expand on how you deliver that benefit
- CTA: One primary action
- Visual: Product in use (not stock photo)

**Social Proof:**
- Customer logos (recognizable brands)
- Specific testimonial quotes with attribution
- Key metrics (e.g., "487 companies trust us")

**Features/Benefits:**
- 3-5 key benefits max
- Lead with benefit, follow with feature explanation
- Use icons for scannability

**Example:**

```
Hero Headline: "Automate Your Marketing. Reclaim Your Time."

Subheadline: "Marketing teams using MarketAI save 5+ hours per week by automating repetitive tasks—so they can focus on strategy and creativity."

CTA: "Start Free Trial →"
```

### Email Campaigns

**Subject Lines:**
- 6-10 words (mobile-friendly)
- Lead with benefit or curiosity
- Use numbers when relevant
- A/B test consistently

**Examples:**
- ✅ "You're wasting 60% of your time on this"
- ✅ "3 ways to automate your campaigns today"
- ✅ "Sarah saved 8 hours this week—here's how"
- ❌ "MarketAI Newsletter - June Edition"
- ❌ "Check out our latest features"

**Email Body:**
- One topic per email
- Scannable structure (headers, bullets, bold)
- One clear CTA
- Personal sign-off

### Social Media Posts

**LinkedIn:**
- Start with a hook (first line is critical)
- Tell a story or share a lesson
- Use short paragraphs (1-2 sentences)
- Include line breaks for readability
- End with a question to drive engagement
- Limit hashtags (2-3 max)

**Example:**

```
The best advice I got as a marketing leader: "Stop trying to do everything."

Three months ago, our team was running 12 campaigns across 8 platforms. We were exhausted. Performance was declining.

So we cut it in half. Six campaigns. Four platforms.

The result? 2x better performance and a team that's actually energized.

Less isn't lazy. It's strategic.

What have you stopped doing that made you more effective?
```

### Blog Posts

**Structure:**
1. Hook (first 2 sentences grab attention)
2. Promise (what they'll learn/gain)
3. Context (why this matters)
4. Tactical steps (the how-to)
5. Summary (key takeaways)
6. CTA (one clear next step)

**Formatting:**
- H2 every 300-400 words
- Bullet lists for scannability
- Bold key phrases
- Include examples
- Add visuals (screenshots, charts)

**Title formulas:**
- "How to [Achieve Result] in [Timeframe]"
- "[Number] Ways to [Solve Problem]"
- "Why [Common Belief] Is Wrong (And What to Do Instead)"
- "The [Process] That Helped [Company/Person] [Achieve Result]"
