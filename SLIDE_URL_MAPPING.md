## Notes:

1. **Vertical Navigation Issues:**
   - Slide 8 (URL #8) has a sub-slide caused by `--` at line 357
   - Slide 10 (URL #10) has a sub-slide caused by `--` at line 475
   - These create up/down arrow navigation

2. **To Fix:**
   - Replace `--` with `---` to make them horizontal slides instead
   - OR remove the sub-slide content and merge into main slide

3. **Total Slides:** 13 slides (0-12)
   - But slides 8 and 10 have vertical sub-slides
   - So actual slide count with verticals is higher
