## Slide 1: The LinkedIn Problem
### ⏱️ 3 minutes

**How much time do you spend on LinkedIn content?**

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 2rem; margin-top: 2rem;">
<div>

### The Time Drain:
- Staring at blank screen: **20 min/post**
- Writing and rewriting: **30 min/post**
- Editing for LinkedIn format: **10 min/post**
- Actually posting: **5 min**

**Total: 65 minutes per post**

**3 posts/week = 3+ hours**

</div>
<div>

### Today's Solution:
Build a Custom GPT that:
- ✅ Writes posts in YOUR voice
- ✅ Follows LinkedIn best practices
- ✅ Actually POSTS for you
- ✅ Takes 2 minutes start to finish

**Result: 65 minutes → 2 minutes**

</div>
</div>

**Plus:** We'll show you how to build and OWN the same tool yourself with MCP (no subscriptions, 100% local).

Note: PRESENTER: Ask the room - "Raise your hand if LinkedIn content takes too long." Pause. "By the end of this session, you'll go from idea to published post in 2 minutes." Start the timer - we have 45 minutes.

## Slide 2: Open GPT Editor Together
### ⏱️ 2 minutes

### 🚨 EVERYONE: Do This Right Now

**Step 1:** Open a new tab
**Step 2:** Go to: **[chatgpt.com/gpts/editor](https://chatgpt.com/gpts/editor)**
**Step 3:** You should see a split screen:
- Left side: Configuration panel
- Right side: Preview chat

<div style="background: #fff3cd; padding: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; border-radius: 8px;">

### ⚠️ If you see "Upgrade to Plus":
You need ChatGPT Plus to continue. Sign up at [chat.openai.com/plus](https://chat.openai.com/plus) ($20/month)

**Backup Plan:** Take detailed notes and build it after the workshop.

</div>

<div style="background: #d1ecf1; padding: 1.5rem; margin-top: 1rem; border-radius: 8px;">

### ✅ Success Check:
Raise your hand when you can see the GPT Editor interface.

*PRESENTER: Wait until 80% of hands are up before continuing.*

</div>

Note: PRESENTER: "I'm screen sharing my GPT Editor now. Your screen should look exactly like mine. If it doesn't, raise your hand and someone will help you." Wait. "Okay, we're going to build this together. Everyone types what I type, when I type it. Stay with me."

---

## Slide 3: Choose Your Template & Name It
### ⏱️ 3 minutes

### Pick ONE template that matches YOUR goal:

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); gap: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0;">

<div style="background: #e3f2fd; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px;">

### 📊 Template A: CEO
**For:** Founders, executives
**Voice:** Strategic thought leadership
**Topics:** Business insights, leadership

</div>

<div style="background: #f3e5f5; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px;">

### 📈 Template B: Marketing
**For:** Marketing pros
**Voice:** Actionable insights
**Topics:** Campaigns, tactics, trends

</div>

<div style="background: #fff3e0; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px;">

### 🤖 Template C: AI Enthusiast
**For:** Tech folks
**Voice:** Practical AI exploration
**Topics:** AI tools, experiments

</div>

</div>

### Now Type This (Example: CEO Template):

<div style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; font-family: monospace; margin: 2rem 0;">

**Name:**
LinkedIn Post Creator - CEO Edition

**Description:**
Creates strategic LinkedIn posts for CEOs and founders focused on business insights, leadership, and company growth.

</div>

**👉 OR:** Go to the workshop template page, click your template tab, click "Copy All"

<div style="background: #d1ecf1; padding: 1rem; margin-top: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px;">

✅ **Done?** The name should appear at the top of your GPT Editor.

</div>

Note: PRESENTER: "Pick a template - CEO, Marketing, or AI Enthusiast. I'm using CEO template today." Show template page on screen. "You can copy/paste from the workshop site OR type along with me. Everyone with me?"

---

## Slide 4: Copy Instructions (The Brain of Your GPT)
### ⏱️ 5 minutes

### This is where the magic happens. Copy/paste from workshop site:

**👉 Go to workshop template page → Click your template tab → Click "Copy" on Instructions section**

**OR** type this example (CEO Template):

<div style="font-size: 0.75em; background: #f8f9fa; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; font-family: monospace; margin: 1rem 0; max-height: 400px; overflow-y: auto;">

You are a LinkedIn post creator specialized in CEO and founder content.

**WRITING STYLE:**
- Professional yet conversational
- Strategic insights backed by real examples
- Mix of storytelling and data
- Authentic voice, not corporate speak
- 150-250 words (LinkedIn sweet spot)

**CONTENT PILLARS:**
1. Business strategy and insights
2. Leadership lessons
3. Company building and culture
4. Industry trends
5. Personal experiences → business lessons

**POST STRUCTURE:**
- Hook (first line grabs attention)
- Story or insight (middle)
- Takeaway or call-to-action (end)

**When creating a post:**
1. Ask what topic or insight the user wants to share
2. Create a draft post
3. Offer 2-3 alternative hooks
4. Refine based on feedback

</div>

<div style="background: #fff3cd; padding: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem; border-radius: 8px;">

### 💡 Pro Tip:
Copy/paste from the workshop site is EASIER than typing. Get it perfect the first time.

</div>

Note: PRESENTER: "Everyone go to the workshop template page right now." Show URL on screen. "Click your template - CEO, Marketing, or AI. Click 'Copy' on the Instructions section. Paste it into your GPT." Demo on screen. "Much easier than typing, right?"

---

## Slide 5: Skip Knowledge for Now
### ⏱️ 1 minute

### We're skipping this to save time (you can add later)

<div style="background: #d1ecf1; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px;">

### Knowledge Files (Optional):
You can upload past LinkedIn posts, brand guidelines, or writing samples to make the GPT match your voice even better.

**For today:** We're skipping this to get to the LinkedIn posting faster.

**After the workshop:** Upload 5-10 of your best LinkedIn posts to fine-tune the voice.

</div>

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem;">

<div style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px;">

### What You COULD Upload:
- Past LinkedIn posts (PDF/text)
- Brand voice guidelines
- Company one-pager
- Your resume/bio

</div>

<div style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px;">

### Why We're Skipping:
- ⏱️ Saves 10 minutes
- ✅ GPT works great without it
- 🎯 Want to get to LinkedIn posting
- 📝 Easy to add later

</div>

</div>

Note: PRESENTER: "We're skipping Knowledge uploads today to save time. The GPT will work great without it. You can always add files later to fine-tune the voice. Let's keep moving - we want to get to the LinkedIn posting!"

---

## Slide 6: Enable Capabilities (Quick)
### ⏱️ 2 minutes

### Just check these two boxes:

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0;">

<div style="background: #d4edda; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px;">

### ✅ Web Browsing
**Why:** Research current trends for your posts

**Example:**
"Research latest AI news and write a post about it"

</div>

<div style="background: #f8d7da; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px;">

### ❌ DALL-E & Code Interpreter
**Skip both** - Not needed for LinkedIn posts

(You can enable later if you want)

</div>

</div>

<div style="background: #d1ecf1; padding: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem; border-radius: 8px;">

### ✅ Your checklist:
- ✅ Web Browsing: CHECKED
- ❌ DALL-E: Unchecked
- ❌ Code Interpreter: Unchecked

</div>

Note: PRESENTER: "Scroll to Capabilities. Check Web Browsing. Leave the rest unchecked. That's it." Demo on screen. "Web Browsing lets your GPT research current trends. You don't need image generation or code for LinkedIn posts."

---

## Slide 7: Quick Test (Does It Work?)
### ⏱️ 3 minutes

### Test your GPT right now in the preview chat:

<div style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; font-family: monospace; margin: 2rem 0;">

**Type this:**
```
Write a LinkedIn post about the importance of AI literacy
for business leaders
```

</div>

### What Should Happen:
- ✅ GPT drafts a post in the style you chose (CEO/Marketing/AI)
- ✅ Post is 150-250 words
- ✅ Has a strong hook
- ✅ Ends with a takeaway

<div style="background: #d1ecf1; padding: 1rem; margin-top: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px;">

### ✅ Working?
Raise your hand if you got a draft post back.

**If it doesn't work:** Check your Instructions were pasted correctly.

</div>

**👉 Don't like the draft?** That's fine! We'll refine it later. For now, we just need to know it's working.

Note: PRESENTER: "Everyone type this test prompt in the preview chat on the right." Show on screen. "Hit enter. You should get a LinkedIn post draft back." Demo the result. "See? It wrote a post. Yours should look similar. Everyone got a post? Great. Now here's where it gets cool..."

---

## Slide 8: Add LinkedIn Posting Power 🚀
### ⏱️ 15 minutes

### Now the cool part: Make it actually POST to LinkedIn

<div style="background: #fff3cd; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 2rem 0;">

### ⚠️ Reality Check:
LinkedIn Actions are **complex** to set up (20-30 minutes with OAuth).

**For today:** We'll use workshop-provided credentials so you can test it.

**After workshop:** You can set up your own (or use the MCP alternative we'll show you).

</div>

### Step 1: Scroll to "Actions" Section

In your GPT Editor, scroll down to **"Actions"** (below Capabilities).

### Step 2: Click "Create new action"

### Step 3: Copy/Paste the OpenAPI Schema

**👉 Go to workshop template page → Scroll to "Actions" → Click "Copy"**

**OR** I'll paste it on screen for you to copy.

Note: PRESENTER: "Scroll down in your GPT Editor. See the Actions section? Click 'Create new action.'" Show on screen. "Now go to the workshop template page. Scroll to the Actions section. Click Copy." Pause. "Everyone found it? Great. Paste it into the Schema box."

--

### Step 4: Configure Authentication

Scroll down to **"Authentication"** section:

1. Select **"Bearer"** from dropdown
2. Paste the workshop access token (I'll provide this)
3. Click **"Test"** - you should see "Success"

<div style="background: #d1ecf1; padding: 1.5rem; margin-top: 1rem; border-radius: 8px;">

### 🔑 Workshop Access Token:
I'll share this in chat / on screen during the workshop.

**Note:** This is a shared token for testing only. After the workshop, you can set up your own OR use the MCP alternative.

</div>

### Step 5: Save Your GPT

1. Click **"Update"** or **"Create"** (top right)
2. Choose **"Only me"** for now
3. Click **"Confirm"**

✅ **You now have a LinkedIn-posting GPT!**

Note: PRESENTER: "Scroll to Authentication. Select Bearer. Here's the access token [paste in chat/show on screen]. Everyone paste it in the Token field." Wait. "Now click Test. You should see success." Verify on screen. "Great! Click Update to save your GPT."

## Slide 9: POST TO LINKEDIN! 🎉
### ⏱️ 5 minutes

### The moment of truth: Let's actually post

<div style="background: #d4edda; padding: 2rem; border-radius: 8px; text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">

# 🚀 Time to Post!

Your GPT can now write AND publish to LinkedIn.

</div>

### Try This Prompt:

<div style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; font-family: monospace; margin: 2rem 0;">

```
Write a LinkedIn post about what I'm learning at this AI workshop
and post it to LinkedIn.

My URN is: urn:li:person:YOUR_URN_HERE
```

</div>

**Replace YOUR_URN_HERE with your actual URN** (we'll help you get this)

### What Will Happen:
1. ✍️ GPT writes a draft post
2. 📝 Shows it to you
3. ❓ Asks "Should I post this?"
4. ✅ You say "yes"
5. 🚀 It posts to LinkedIn!

### Check LinkedIn:
Open LinkedIn on your phone or another tab - **your post should be live!**

Note: PRESENTER: "Everyone needs their LinkedIn URN. Go to [show method to get URN]. Copy it." Help people get their URNs. "Now go to your GPT. Type the prompt with your URN." Demo on screen. "Watch - it's writing... now asking if I want to post... I say yes... BOOM. Check LinkedIn - it's live!" Show LinkedIn with the new post.

## Slide 10: The WOW - Own It Yourself with MCP 🤯
### ⏱️ 10 minutes

### You just experienced how EASY AI tools can be...

### Do you OWN this tool?

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 2rem; margin: 2rem 0;">

<div style="background: #fff3cd; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px;">

### ❌ What You DON'T Own:
- Requires ChatGPT Plus ($20/month forever)
- Your data trains OpenAI's models*
- Dependent on OpenAI
- Limited to ChatGPT
- Complex OAuth setup (LinkedIn Action)

*Unless you opt-out

</div>

<div style="background: #d4edda; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px;">

### ✅ The Alternative - MCP:
- $0 cost (runs on your laptop)
- 100% local option
- Use ANY LLM (Claude, ChatGPT, Ollama)
- You own 100% of your data
- Easier to set up

</div>

</div>

### Live Demo: LinkedIn MCP Server

**Same functionality. Different ownership model.**

**I'm going to show you:**
1. LinkedIn MCP server (posts to LinkedIn)
2. Runs 100% on my laptop
3. Works with local LLM (Ollama - free)
4. Also works with Claude Desktop

**The post looks identical. But I own the entire stack.**

Note: PRESENTER: "Let me show you the alternative." Switch to terminal. "This is the LinkedIn MCP server running locally." Show the code. "100 lines of JavaScript. Open source. You can verify exactly what it does." Run the transparency CLI demo with Ollama. "This is analyzing Anthropic's privacy policy - 100% on my laptop, using a free local LLM." Show the results. "Same output as ChatGPT, but I own it."

--

### The Choice

| Feature | Custom GPT (Today) | MCP (Alternative) |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Setup | Easy (copy/paste) | Medium (code) |
| Cost | $20/month | $0 |
| Privacy | Cloud | 100% Local option |
| Ownership | OpenAI | You |
| Flexibility | Limited | Unlimited |

**The point isn't that one is better.**

**The point is: YOU GET TO CHOOSE.**

### The Real "Moat" in AI

**The tools look identical.**
**The LinkedIn posts look identical.**
**The analysis looks identical.**

**But three things are different:**

1. **Who owns your data** after you use it
2. **Incentives** - Are they selling subscriptions or empowering you?
3. **Imagination** - What will you build?

Note: PRESENTER: "Show the comparison table. "Both work. Both post to LinkedIn. Both analyze privacy policies. But who owns your data? Completely different." Pause. "AI can mean Artificial intelligence, incentivized by advertising. OR AI can mean Accessible intelligence, incentivized by education. You choose."

## Slide 11: What You Learned Today
### ⏱️ 2 minutes

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">

# 🎉 You Did It!

</div>

### What You Built:
✅ Custom GPT that writes LinkedIn posts in YOUR voice
✅ Added LinkedIn Action that actually POSTS for you
✅ Went from idea → published post in 2 minutes
✅ Experienced how EASY AI tools can be

### What You Learned:
💡 That there's an alternative (MCP, local, owned by you)
💡 The "moat" isn't technology - it's ownership, incentives, imagination
💡 Your data doesn't have to be "just a given"

<div style="background: #667eea; color: white; padding: 2rem; border-radius: 12px; text-align: center; margin-top: 2rem;">

### Remember:

> **"AI can mean Artificial intelligence, incentivized by advertising and marketing."**
>
> **"OR"**
>
> **"AI can mean Accessible intelligence, incentivized by education and well-being."**

**You get to choose.**

</div>

Note: PRESENTER: "You experienced both today. Custom GPT - easy but you don't own it. MCP - slightly harder but you own everything. Choose based on your needs." Pause. "Hmmm... there's that imagination again."
