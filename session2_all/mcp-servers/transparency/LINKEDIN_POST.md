# LinkedIn Post Draft

Over the past few weeks, I used AI to accelerate my ability to read through the actual privacy policies of every major AI tool.

A fun practice: turn them into podcasts for long runs. It really is a menagerie of language that few could convince me LLMs are a generation away from typing "rolling my digital eyes" when I make them use my MCP-server toolkit called Transparency.

**🔴 ChatGPT Free**
- Trains on your conversations (unless you opt-out)
- 30-day retention when history disabled
- Source: openai.com/enterprise-privacy

**🟡 Claude Free/Pro/Max (NEW 2025 Policy)**
- NOW trains on your data IF you opt-in
- 5-year retention if training enabled
- 30-day retention if disabled
- Deadline: October 8, 2025 to choose
- Source: anthropic.com/news/updates-to-our-consumer-terms

**🟢 ChatGPT API / Claude API**
- Does NOT train on your data
- 30-day retention for abuse monitoring only
- Source: privacy.anthropic.com, openai.com/enterprise-privacy

**🔵 Local/Self-Hosted (LM Studio, Ollama)**
- You own 100% of your data
- Nothing leaves your machine
- Zero cloud retention

**AI Wrappers (100K+ users) that DON'T disclose their backend:**
Copy.ai (15M), Jasper (100K+), Notion AI (100M+), Grammarly (30M daily), Replit AI (30M+), Codeium (700K+), Character.AI (20M MAU)

When you use these, you have **TWO layers of privacy policies**—you can't even verify which one governs your data.

**The tools look identical. The posts look identical. The outputs look identical.**

**But here's the real question: Is AI using you, or are you using AI to become a Producer?**

The incentives matter.

**AI** can mean **Artificial** intelligence, incentivized by advertising and marketing.

OR

**AI** can mean **Accessible** intelligence, incentivized by education and well-being.

**To revolutionize choice** is the reality of what local inference and local AI infrastructure provide: **accessible intelligence** where YOU are the producer, not the product.

I'm not hating the players. I'm hating the incentives that say technology is more important than people. I'm hating the idea that your data is "just a given."

Your data doesn't have to be just a given.

Hmmm... there's that imagination again.

**So I built a tool to help you do this analysis yourself:**

🔧 **Transparency MCP Server** - Analyze privacy policies with any LLM (Claude, ChatGPT, or 100% local via Ollama)

GitHub: [YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL]

Three tools:
- `fetch_policy` - Extract privacy policy text from any URL
- `analyze_policy` - Analyze for training, retention, opt-out, third-party sharing
- `compare_policies` - Side-by-side comparison

Works with:
✅ Claude Desktop
✅ Custom GPTs
✅ Local LLMs (Ollama, LM Studio)
✅ Any MCP-compatible client

**Use it. Fork it. Verify my claims. Build on it.**

Because transparency isn't a feature request—it's a requirement.
