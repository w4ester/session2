# Custom GPT Workshop for CEOs: Anatomy Version

**40-minute workshop using the "Architecture-First" approach**

## Overview

This is the **Anatomy Version** of the Custom GPT workshop, specifically designed for CEO and executive audiences. Unlike the progressive approach (which builds step-by-step), this version shows the complete system architecture upfront, then guides participants through configuring each component.

### Philosophy: "Architecture First, Then Configure"

**Traditional approach:** "Let's start with instructions, then add knowledge, then capabilities..."

**Anatomy approach:** "Here's the complete system with 6 components - now let's configure each module"

**Why this works for CEOs:**
- Executives are used to system diagrams, org charts, and architectural overviews
- They want to see the full picture before diving into details
- They think in frameworks and structures, not sequential steps
- They need to understand ROI and scale potential upfront

## What's Different from the Progressive Version?

| Aspect | Progressive Version | Anatomy Version |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Audience** | Marketers, individual contributors | CEOs, executives, leadership |
| **Approach** | Build incrementally, reveal features over time | Show full architecture upfront |
| **First 5 minutes** | "What is a Custom GPT?" | "Here are the 6 components of a Custom GPT" |
| **Focus** | Hands-on tools (tokenizer, prompt checker) | ROI, company rollout, adoption metrics |
| **Examples** | Social media posts, email campaigns | Executive summaries, strategic planning briefs |
| **Duration** | 60 minutes | 40 minutes (executive-optimized) |
| **Outcome** | Individual productivity tool | Company-wide AI infrastructure |

## Workshop Structure (40 Minutes)

### Slide 1: The CEO's AI Problem (5 min)
- Pain Point: Wasting 5+ hours/week on repetitive strategic tasks
- Cost Calculation: $125,000/year in CEO time
- Solution: Custom GPTs encode knowledge once, deploy everywhere

### Slide 2: Custom GPT Anatomy (5 min) - KEY SLIDE
- Show complete architecture upfront
- 6 Core Components: Name, Instructions, Knowledge, Capabilities, Starters, Actions

### Slide 3: Build Together (20 min)
- Live Build: Create Campaign Brief Generator
- ROI: $63,720 annual savings
- Scale: 50 GPTs × 200 users = $13M annual value

### Slide 4: Test & Refine (7 min)
- 3 Test Prompts
- Common Issues & Fixes
- 1-hour to production

### Slide 5: Company Rollout Strategy (3 min)
- 3-Phase Rollout (Pilot → Department → Company)
- 5 Adoption Metrics
- GPT Library Vision

## Key Advantages of Anatomy-First Approach

1. **Faster Comprehension** - CEOs grasp complete system in 5 minutes
2. **Better Questions** - Strategic questions instead of "what's next?"
3. **Improved Retention** - Architecture is memorable framework
4. **Credibility & Trust** - Transparency builds confidence
5. **Action-Oriented** - Clear roadmap to configure 6 components

## Presenter Notes

### Key Messages for Each Section

**Section 1: Understanding Custom GPTs (5 min)**
- Don't rush the architecture diagram - this is the foundation
- Emphasize: "You're configuring a system, not programming"
- Answer: "Why 6 components?" - Each serves a specific purpose in the system

**Section 2: Build Together (20 min)**
- Live demo is critical - don't just show slides
- Open chatgpt.com/gpts/editor and build in real-time
- Pause frequently to let participants follow along
- ROI calculation should resonate: $63K annual savings for ONE GPT

**Section 3: Test & Refine (7 min)**
- Show actual test results (good and bad)
- Normalize iteration: "Version 1.0 is never perfect"
- Emphasize: 1 hour to production (not 6 months)

**Section 4: Company Rollout (3 min)**
- This is where executives get excited about scale
- Don't skip the 3-phase rollout - this prevents "build and abandon"
- End with vision: 50 GPTs × 200 users = $13M annual value
