## Example 1: All-Hands Email - Q4 Results

**Subject: Q4 Results: What We Achieved and What's Next**

Team,

I wanted to share our Q4 results and what they mean for our 2025 strategy.

**The Numbers:**
- Revenue: $12.4M (↑ 34% YoY)
- New customers: 487 (↑ 28% YoY)
- Gross margin: 72% (↑ from 68%)
- Net dollar retention: 118%

These results reflect the hard work you've all put in—particularly our enterprise sales push and the product improvements that reduced churn by 15%.

**What's Working:**
1. **Enterprise momentum** - Our top 50 accounts grew 2.3x, validating our upmarket strategy
2. **Product-market fit** - Usage metrics show customers are extracting real value
3. **Team execution** - We shipped 4 major features on time despite a lean team

**Where We're Short:**
- Mid-market segment underperformed (missed target by 22%)
- Implementation time still too long (avg 47 days vs 30-day goal)
- Customer support response times slipped in December

**2025 Priorities:**
We're doubling down on what's working while fixing what's not:

1. **Enterprise-first** - 60% of resources to accounts >$100K ARR
2. **Faster onboarding** - New implementation team starts January 15
3. **Product velocity** - Shipping

 weekly vs monthly to stay ahead

I'll share more detail in our January all-hands, but wanted you to see the numbers first.

Thank you for an incredible Q4. Let's make 2025 our best year yet.

— Sarah

## Example 2: Board Update - Strategic Pivot

**To:** Board of Directors
**From:** Sarah Chen, CEO
**Re:** Q2 Board Update - Enterprise Pivot
**Date:** June 30, 2024

**Executive Summary:**

We're pivoting from SMB-focused to enterprise-first. Early signals (5 deals >$100K in Q2) validate the opportunity. This requires changes to sales, product, and GTM, but positions us for sustainable growth.

**Q2 Performance:**
- ARR: $8.2M (↑ 41% YoY)
- Gross churn: 4.2% (↑ from 3.1% - see below)
- CAC payback: 14 months (↑ from 11 - also see below)
- Burn: $420K/month

**Why We're Pivoting:**

Our SMB motion is hitting a ceiling:
- High churn (4.2% monthly) due to budget constraints
- Long payback (14mo) because SMB CAC stayed high while ACV stayed low
- Commoditization pressure from new free tools

Meanwhile, our enterprise experiments are working:
- 5 deals >$100K closed in Q2 (vs 0 in Q1)
- These customers have 0% churn and expand aggressively
- Sales cycles are longer (90 days) but payback is faster (8 months)
- Product is actually better suited for enterprise workflows

**The Plan:**

1. **Sales:** Hire 2 enterprise AEs, promote Alex to lead enterprise sales
2. **Product:** Build SSO, advanced permissioning, audit logs (enterprise table stakes)
3. **Marketing:** Shift from PLG to ABM for top 500 target accounts
4. **Timeline:** 6 months to complete transition

**Risks:**
- Execution risk: Never sold enterprise before
- Product gaps: 6-month roadmap to be enterprise-ready
- Cash: Need to extend runway by raising $3-5M in Q4

**Ask of Board:**
- Feedback on pivot rationale
- Intros to potential customers in target segments
- Support on fundraising timing and narrative

Detailed financials and GTM plan attached.

## Example 3: LinkedIn Post - Leadership Lesson

**Post:**

The best leadership advice I got: "Your job is to make decisions with incomplete information."

Three months ago, we had to choose: double down on SMB or pivot to enterprise.

The data was mixed. Some board members said wait. My gut said we couldn't afford to.

Here's what I learned about making hard calls:

1. **Get 70% confident, not 100%** - You'll never have perfect data. Move at 70%.

2. **Make it reversible if you can** - We kept SMB going while testing enterprise. Hedged the bet.

3. **Commit publicly** - Once decided, tell the team WHY and OWN it. Doubt kills momentum.

4. **Set milestones to reassess** - "If we don't see X by Y date, we pivot again." Built in escape hatches.

5. **Be wrong loudly** - If it fails, say so fast. The team respects honesty more than being right.

We're 3 months into the enterprise pivot. Early results are promising. But I won't know if it was the right call for another 6 months.

That's the job. Make the call. Learn fast. Adjust.

What's helped you make decisions with incomplete information?
