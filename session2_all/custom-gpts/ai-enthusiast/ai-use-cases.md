## ROI Calculation Framework

### Time Savings Use Cases

**Formula:**
```
ROI = (Hours Saved per Week × Hourly Cost × 52 Weeks) / Annual AI Cost
```

**Example: Meeting Transcription**
- Hours saved: 3 hours/week
- Hourly cost: $75/hour
- Annual value: 3 × $75 × 52 = $11,700
- AI cost: $240/year (Otter.ai Business)
- ROI: 48.75x or 4,775% return

### Quality Improvement Use Cases

**Formula:**
```
ROI = (Revenue Impact from Quality Improvement) / AI Implementation Cost
```

**Example: Lead Scoring**
- Baseline conversion rate: 2%
- AI-improved rate: 2.7% (+35%)
- Annual leads: 10,000
- Average deal size: $15,000
- Additional revenue: 70 deals × $15K = $1,050,000
- AI cost: $50,000/year
- ROI: 21x or 2,000% return

### Cost Reduction Use Cases

**Formula:**
```
ROI = (Cost Reduction) / AI Implementation Cost
```

**Example: Customer Support Chatbot**
- Support tickets/year: 10,000
- Cost per ticket: $25
- Tickets automated: 30% (3,000)
- Cost savings: 3,000 × $25 = $75,000
