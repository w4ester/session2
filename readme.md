## 🎤 Complete Presenter Script

### Opening (2 minutes before start)

**As people are joining:**

"Welcome everyone! Before we start, please make sure you can access chatgpt.com/gpts/editor. Open it now in a new tab. If you see 'Upgrade to Plus,' you'll need a ChatGPT Plus subscription to follow along. That's okay - you can take notes and build it after the workshop. But ideally, you have access now."

[Wait, watch hands, help anyone struggling]

"Great. Keep that tab open. We're going to start in about 1 minute."

---

### Slide 0: Title (0:00 - 0:30)

**SCRIPT:**

"Good morning/afternoon. I'm [Name], and for the next 40 minutes, we're going to do something different. This isn't a presentation where you sit back and listen. This is a BUILD session."

[Pause for emphasis]

"By the time we're done - in exactly 40 minutes - you will have built a Custom GPT that saves you 5 hours per week on executive communications. Board decks, investor updates, strategic briefs - all of it."

"Here's how this works: I'm going to screen share my GPT Editor. You're going to have yours open. When I type something, you type it. When I click something, you click it. Everyone stays with me. No one gets left behind."

"Questions before we start? No? Good. Let's build."

[Start timer - begin at exactly 0:00]

---

### Slide 1: The 5-Hour CEO Problem (0:30 - 3:30)

**SCRIPT:**

"Quick show of hands - who here spends more than 2 hours per week writing board presentations, investor updates, or strategic briefs?"

[Wait for hands]

"Yeah. Most of you. That's the problem we're solving today."

"Look at these numbers:"

[Point to slide]

"Board presentations: 2 hours per week. Investor updates: 1.5 hours. Document reviews: 1 hour. Strategic briefs: 45 minutes. Total: 5+ hours per week. That's 260 hours per year you're spending on repetitive writing."

[Pause]

"What if that became 30 minutes per week? What would you do with an extra 230 hours per year?"

[Let that sink in]

"That's what we're building today. An AI assistant that writes in YOUR voice, uses YOUR company's data, follows YOUR guidelines. It drafts in 5 minutes what takes you 2 hours. And the quality? We'll test it together."

"Okay. Let's build it."

---

### Slide 2: Open GPT Editor Together (3:30 - 5:30)

**SCRIPT:**

"Everyone - do this right now:"

[Speak slowly and clearly]

"Step 1: Open a new browser tab.
Step 2: Go to chatgpt.com/gpts/editor.
Step 3: You should see a split screen. Configuration on the left, preview chat on the right."

[Show your screen]

"My screen looks like this. Does yours look like this?"

[Wait, watch for confusion]

"If you see 'Upgrade to Plus' - you need ChatGPT Plus. That's a $20/month subscription. If you don't have it right now, that's okay. Take detailed notes. You can build this after the workshop when you upgrade. But for now, watch carefully."

[Pause]

"Raise your hand if you can see the GPT Editor interface."

[Wait for at least 80% of hands]

"Great. Everyone else, pair up with someone who has it open. Share a screen."

[Wait 10 seconds]

"Okay. From this point forward, you follow my lead. I'm going to type slowly. You type what I type. Ready? Here we go."

---

### Slide 3: Name & Description (5:30 - 7:30)

**SCRIPT:**

"First thing - we need to name this GPT. I'm going to type in the Name field."

[Type slowly while speaking]

"Executive... Communication... Assistant."

[Pause]

"Everyone with me? Look at your screen. You should see 'Executive Communication Assistant' at the top now."

[Wait 3 seconds]

"Good. Now the description. This is a one-sentence summary of what it does. I'm typing in the Description field:"

[Type slowly, reading aloud]

"Drafts... board presentations... investor updates... and strategic briefs... in [Your Company]'s voice."

[Pause]

"Now - replace [Your Company] with your actual company name. I'm putting 'Acme Corp' because this is a demo. You put your real company name."

[Pause while they do it]

"Everyone got it? Your company name should be in there."

[Quick scan of the room]

"Perfect. Next step."

---

### Slide 4: Instructions (7:30 - 17:30) [THIS IS THE LONGEST SECTION]

**SCRIPT:**

"Okay, this is the most important part. This is where we give the GPT its personality, its rules, its brain. I'm going to type this slowly. You can either copy-paste from the workshop site, OR type along with me. Your choice."

[Pull up the instructions template on screen]

"I'm starting in the Instructions field. Here we go:"

[Type slowly, section by section. Read each line out loud as you type.]

"You... are... an... Executive Communication Assistant... for... [Your Company]."

[Pause]

"Again, use your real company name."

[Continue typing]

"Your Role:
- Draft board presentations, investor updates, and strategic briefs
- Always use a confident, clear, executive tone
- Include data-driven insights and metrics
- Structure content for busy executives (top-line summary first)
- Ask clarifying questions before drafting"

[Pause between each bullet. Look up at the audience.]

"Everyone still with me? This is telling the GPT how to behave. What tone to use. What structure to follow."

[Continue]

"Tone & Style:
- Professional but not stuffy
- Data-driven and factual
- Strategic focus (big picture + key details)
- Concise - every word counts
- Action-oriented"

[Pause]

"This is YOUR voice. If you want a different tone - more formal, less formal, more technical - change these words. Make it match how YOU actually write."

[Continue with Content Structure section]

"Content Structure:
1. Executive Summary (3-5 bullet points)
2. Situation/Context
3. Data & Insights
4. Recommendations
5. Next Steps"

[Pause]

"This is the template it will follow. Every time. Consistent structure = easier for your audience to consume."

[Continue with "Before drafting" section]

"Before drafting, always ask:
- What is the audience? (Board, investors, internal team?)
- What is the key message?
- What decisions need to be made?
- What data should be highlighted?"

[Pause]

"This is critical. We want the GPT to ask US questions, not make assumptions. That way, the output is exactly what we need."

[Final section - "Never"]

"Never:
- Use jargon without explanation
- Make recommendations without data
- Write long paragraphs (use bullets)
- Assume context - ask questions"

[Pause, look up]

"These are hard rules. Things the GPT should NEVER do. This prevents it from producing generic corporate jargon nonsense."

[Wait 10 seconds]

"Okay. Look at your Instructions field. It should have all of that. Take 30 seconds. Read through it. Make any small tweaks you want. This is YOUR GPT, not mine."

[WAIT 30 SECONDS - this is important for them to personalize]

"Great. Everyone ready? Next step."

---

### Slide 5: Upload Knowledge (17:30 - 25:30)

**SCRIPT:**

"Now we're going to give the GPT YOUR company's knowledge. This is what makes it smart about YOUR business."

[Click Knowledge section]

"See the Knowledge section? Click that. Now click 'Upload files.'"

[Show on screen]

"What should you upload? Three things:"

[Point to slide]

"One: Past successful documents. Your best board deck. Your best investor update. 2-3 examples of your writing when you nailed it. The GPT will learn your style from these."

"Two: Brand guidelines. If you have a document about your company's tone, voice, messaging - upload it."

"Three: Company data. Mission statement, vision, key metrics, anything that provides context about your business."

[Pause]

"I'm going to upload a sample brand guidelines document now. Watch my screen."

[Upload the sample-brand-guidelines.md file - MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THIS READY]

"Click Upload files. Select your document. It'll take a few seconds."

[Wait for green checkmark to appear on screen]

"See that green checkmark? That means it's loaded. The GPT now has access to this knowledge. It will reference it when drafting."

[Look at audience]

"Your turn. If you have documents ready, upload them now. If you don't, that's okay. You can add them later. The GPT still works without them - it just won't be as personalized yet."

[WAIT 3-5 MINUTES while they upload. Walk around if possible. Help anyone struggling.]

"Okay, whether you uploaded or not, let's keep moving. You can always add more knowledge later."

---

### Slide 6: Enable Capabilities (25:30 - 30:30)

**SCRIPT:**

"Next: Capabilities. These are the tools we give the GPT."

[Scroll to Capabilities section]

"You see three options: Web Browsing, DALL-E Image Generation, and Code Interpreter."

"Here's when to use each:"

[Point to slide]

"Web Browsing: Enable this if you want the GPT to research current trends, look up competitors, find recent data. For example, you could say 'Research the latest SaaS pricing trends and include them in my brief.' Useful? Yes. I'm enabling it."

[Check the box on screen]

"DALL-E: This generates images. Simple diagrams, charts, visual explanations. If you want the GPT to create a diagram of your 3-year strategy, this does it. I'm enabling it too."

[Check the box]

"Code Interpreter: This is for analyzing data, running calculations, creating charts from CSVs. For executive communication, you usually don't need this. You can always enable it later if you find you need it."

[Leave it unchecked]

"So I've got Web Browsing and DALL-E checked. Code Interpreter unchecked. You can do the same, or make a different choice. Totally up to you and what you need."

[Pause]

"Everyone got their capabilities set? Good. Almost done. One more step."

---

### Slide 7: Test Together (30:30 - 35:30)

**SCRIPT:**

"Alright. Moment of truth. Does this thing actually work? Let's find out."

[Pull up the test prompts on slide]

"See the preview chat on the right side of your GPT Editor? That's where we test. I'm going to copy Test 1 and paste it in."

[Copy and paste the test prompt into the chat]

"Test 1 says: 'Draft a 1-page investor update covering our Q4 performance: Revenue up 25% to $5M, new enterprise customers: 12, product launch successful, raised $10M Series A.'"

[Hit enter]

"Watch what happens."

[WAIT for the GPT to respond - this takes 5-10 seconds]

"Look at this. See how it structures the response? Executive summary at the top. Bullets, not paragraphs. Data-driven. Clear. Concise. This is what we programmed it to do."

[Scroll through the response]

"And look - it's asking clarifying questions at the end. 'What's the target audience? Should I emphasize the fundraise or the customer growth?' That's exactly what we told it to do."

[Look at audience]

"Your turn. Copy Test 1 or Test 2 into your preview chat. Hit enter. See what you get."

[WAIT 2-3 MINUTES while they test]

"Raise your hand if it's working. If you got a good response."

[Wait for hands]

"Great! Most of you. If yours didn't work, we'll troubleshoot after. But for most of you, you just built a working AI assistant."

"Try another test if you have time. Test 2 or Test 3. Get a feel for how it responds."

[Wait another minute]

"Okay, moving on. Last step."

---

### Slide 8: Save & Share (35:30 - 38:30)

**SCRIPT:**

"You built it. Now let's make it official. We need to save this so you can use it outside of the editor."

[Click Save button in top right]

"Click Save. Top right corner."

[Show on screen]

"Now you get three choices for visibility:"

[Point to options]

"'Only me' - that means only you can use it. Too restrictive. We want to share this with our team."

"'Public' - that means it's listed in the GPT Store. Everyone in the world can see it. For an executive communication GPT with your company's data? Not secure. Don't do this."

"'Only people with a link' - this is the sweet spot. Anyone with the link can use it, but it's not publicly listed. This is what we want."

[Select "Only people with a link"]

"I'm choosing 'Only people with a link.' You should too."

[Click Create or Update]

"Click Create."

[WAIT for it to save - takes 3-5 seconds]

"Done! Now you have a link. Copy it."

[Copy the link on screen]

"This link looks like: chatgpt.com/g/g-xxxxx-executive-communication-assistant. This is your GPT's permanent home."

[Paste it somewhere visible - maybe Slack or an email]

"Send this link to your team. Your EA, your executive team, anyone who writes executive communications. They can start using it immediately."

[Pause]

"One important note: They need ChatGPT Plus to use it. It's $20 per month per person. Totally worth it if they're saving 5 hours a week, but they do need the subscription."

[Look at audience]

"Everyone got their link copied? Great. You're done. You just built a Custom GPT that will save you 5+ hours per week."

"Let's talk about what to do next."

---

### Slide 9: The Delegation Playbook (38:30 - 40:00)

**SCRIPT:**

"So you built YOUR GPT. Awesome. But here's the real opportunity:"

[Pause for emphasis]

"What if your entire company did this? What if every department had 3 GPTs that saved them 5 hours per week?"

[Let that sink in]

"That's the transformation you can lead. Here's the playbook."

[Point to the table on slide]

"Phase 1: Week 1-2. Your mission is to PROVE this works. Use your GPT every single day. Track every task. Time how long it takes with the GPT vs without it. Measure the quality on a 1-10 scale. Document your wins."

"Phase 2: Week 3. You present your results to your leadership team. Simple slide deck. 'I was spending 5 hours a week on this. I built a GPT in 40 minutes. I now spend 30 minutes. Quality is 8/10. We should roll this out company-wide.'"

"Phase 3: Week 4-6. Every department builds 3 GPTs. Sales builds a proposal generator. Marketing builds a campaign brief generator. Product builds a PRD generator. You get the idea."

[Point to the suggested GPT library on slide]

"This isn't just about saving time. This is about multiplying your team's expertise. Everyone becomes 3x more productive. That's the transformation."

---

### Slide 10: Q&A & Next Steps (40:00 - 45:00)

**SCRIPT:**

"We're at time. Let me wrap up."

"What you built today will save you 260 hours per year. That's 6.5 work weeks. Now multiply that across your team."

"Your homework:"
1. Use this GPT daily for 2 weeks
2. Track your time saved
3. Share your wins with leadership
4. Plan your rollout"

"All the resources you need are on the workshop site. The written guide, the troubleshooting section, the delegation playbook - it's all there."

[Show workshop site]

"Questions?"

[Take 2-3 quick questions]

"Common questions:"
- 'How do I improve my GPT?' - Keep using it. Update the instructions based on what's working and what's not.
- 'What about security?' - Don't upload confidential client data. Stick to general guidelines and templates.
- 'How much does this scale?' - $20/month per user. Calculate ROI based on hours saved.

"Thank you all for building with me today. You're now equipped to lead AI transformation at your company. Go use it!"

## 🚨 Backup Plans (If Things Go Wrong)

### If GPT Editor is Down:
1. **Acknowledge immediately:** "Looks like OpenAI's servers are having issues. This happens."
2. **Show pre-built GPT:** "I'm going to show you a GPT I built earlier. Watch how it works."
3. **Walk through instructions:** Use slides to explain each section verbally
4. **Provide written guide:** "Everything is in the workshop site. You can build this later."
5. **Pivot to strategy:** Spend more time on the Delegation Playbook and ROI discussion

### If Someone Can't Access ChatGPT Plus:
1. **Pair them up:** "Share a screen with someone next to you"
