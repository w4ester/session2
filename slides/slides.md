## Slide 1: The 5-Hour CEO Problem
### ⏱️ 3 minutes

**What repetitive tasks are eating YOUR time?**

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 2rem; margin-top: 2rem;">
<div>

### Common Time Drains:
- Board presentations: **2 hours/week**
- Investor updates: **1.5 hours/week**
- Team document reviews: **1 hour/week**
- Strategic briefs: **45 min/week**

**Total: 5+ hours/week = 260 hours/year**

</div>
<div>

### Today's Solution:
Build a Custom GPT that:
- ✅ Writes in YOUR voice
- ✅ Uses YOUR company data
- ✅ Follows YOUR guidelines
- ✅ Drafts in 5 minutes vs 2 hours

**Result: 5 hours → 30 minutes**

</div>
</div>

Note: PRESENTER: Ask the room - "Raise your hand if you spend 2+ hours per week writing executive communications." Pause. "By the end of this session, that becomes 20 minutes." Start the timer - we have 40 minutes.

## Slide 2: Open GPT Editor Together
### ⏱️ 2 minutes

### 🚨 EVERYONE: Do This Right Now

**Step 1:** Open a new tab
**Step 2:** Go to: **[chatgpt.com/gpts/editor](https://chatgpt.com/gpts/editor)**
**Step 3:** You should see a split screen:
- Left side: Configuration panel
- Right side: Preview chat

<div style="background: #fff3cd; padding: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; border-radius: 8px;">

### ⚠️ If you see "Upgrade to Plus":
You need ChatGPT Plus to continue. Sign up at [chat.openai.com/plus](https://chat.openai.com/plus) ($20/month)

**Backup Plan:** Take detailed notes and build it after the workshop.

</div>

<div style="background: #d1ecf1; padding: 1.5rem; margin-top: 1rem; border-radius: 8px;">

### ✅ Success Check:
Raise your hand when you can see the GPT Editor interface.

*PRESENTER: Wait until 80% of hands are up before continuing.*

</div>

Note: PRESENTER: "I'm screen sharing my GPT Editor now. Your screen should look exactly like mine. If it doesn't, raise your hand and someone will help you." Wait. "Okay, we're going to build this together. Everyone types what I type, when I type it. Stay with me."

---

## Slide 3: Name & Description (Type With Me)
### ⏱️ 2 minutes

### Type This EXACTLY (Replace [Your Company] with your actual company name):

<div style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; font-family: monospace; margin: 2rem 0;">

**Name:**
Executive Communication Assistant

**Description:**
Drafts board presentations, investor updates, and strategic briefs in [Your Company]'s voice. Uses data-driven insights and maintains a confident, clear executive tone.

</div>

### What I'm Typing on Screen (Follow Along):

**Name field:** "Executive Communication Assistant"

**Description field:** "Drafts board presentations, investor updates, and strategic briefs in Acme Corp's voice. Uses data-driven insights and maintains a confident, clear executive tone."

<div style="background: #d1ecf1; padding: 1rem; margin-top: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px;">

✅ **Done?** The name should appear at the top of your GPT Editor.

</div>

Note: PRESENTER: Type slowly. Read out loud as you type. "Everyone with me? Look at your screen - you should see 'Executive Communication Assistant' at the top now." Pause. "Great. Next step."

---

## Slide 4: Instructions (The Most Important Part)
### ⏱️ 10 minutes

### This is where the magic happens. Type this template:

<div style="font-size: 0.85em; background: #f8f9fa; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; font-family: monospace; margin: 1rem 0;">

You are an Executive Communication Assistant for [Your Company].

**Your Role:**
- Draft board presentations, investor updates, and strategic briefs
- Always use a confident, clear, executive tone
- Include data-driven insights and metrics
- Structure content for busy executives (top-line summary first)
- Ask clarifying questions before drafting

**Tone & Style:**
- Professional but not stuffy
- Data-driven and factual
- Strategic focus (big picture + key details)
- Concise - every word counts
- Action-oriented

**Content Structure:**
1. Executive Summary (3-5 bullet points)
2. Situation/Context
3. Data & Insights
4. Recommendations
5. Next Steps

**Before drafting, always ask:**
- What is the audience? (Board, investors, internal team?)
- What is the key message?
- What decisions need to be made?
- What data should be highlighted?

**Never:**
- Use jargon without explanation
- Make recommendations without data
- Write long paragraphs (use bullets)
- Assume context - ask questions

</div>

Note: PRESENTER: "I'm going to type this slowly. You can copy-paste from the workshop site OR type along with me. The key is to customize [Your Company] with your actual company name." Type slowly, section by section. Pause between sections. "Everyone still with me? This is the brain of your GPT."

### Don't have docs ready?
Use our sample template: [Download sample brand guidelines](../assets/sample-brand-guidelines.pdf)

Or skip this step and add knowledge later.

</div>

Note: PRESENTER: "Click Knowledge section. Now Upload files. I'm uploading a sample board deck from Q3. You can upload 2-3 of your best past documents." Upload a file on screen. "See the green checkmark? That means it's loaded. The GPT will now reference this when drafting."

## Slide 6: Enable Capabilities (Choose Your Tools)
### ⏱️ 5 minutes

### What capabilities should you enable?

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; gap: 1rem; margin: 2rem 0;">

<div style="background: #d4edda; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px;">

### ✅ Web Browsing
**Enable if:**
- Want GPT to research current trends
- Need real-time industry data
- Want competitor analysis

**Example use:**
"Research latest SaaS pricing trends and include in brief"

</div>

<div style="background: #d4edda; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px;">

### ✅ DALL-E
**Enable if:**
- Want simple diagrams
- Need visual explanations
- Creating presentation graphics

**Example use:**
"Create a diagram showing our 3-year growth strategy"

</div>

<div style="background: #f8d7da; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px;">

### ❌ Code Interpreter

**Enable later if:**
Analyzing CSV data, creating charts

</div>

</div>

### What I'm Enabling on Screen:
- ✅ Web Browsing
- ✅ DALL-E Image Generation
- ❌ Code Interpreter (not needed yet)

Note: PRESENTER: "Look at the Capabilities section. I'm checking Web Browsing and DALL-E. For most executive communication, you don't need Code Interpreter. You can always add it later." Click through on screen. "Everyone see these checkboxes?"

## Slide 7: Test Together (Does It Work?)
### ⏱️ 5 minutes

### Let's test your GPT right now. Try these prompts:

<div style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem 0;">

**Test 1 - Basic Draft:**
```
Draft a 1-page investor update covering our Q4 performance:
- Revenue up 25% to $5M
- New enterprise customers: 12
- Product launch successful
- Raised $10M Series A
```

</div>

<div style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem 0;">

**Test 2 - Board Presentation:**
```
Create a 5-slide board presentation outline on our 2025
strategic priorities: expansion to Europe, new product line,
and team growth.
```

</div>

<div style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem 0;">

**Test 3 - With Questions (GPT should ask for clarity):**
```
I need to write an update for our investors about a
strategic pivot.
```

</div>

### What Should Happen:
- ✅ GPT should respond in executive tone
- ✅ Should structure with Executive Summary first
- ✅ Should ask clarifying questions when needed
- ✅ Output should be concise and data-driven

Note: PRESENTER: "Copy Test 1 into the preview chat on the right. Hit enter. Watch what happens." Demo on screen. "See how it structures the response? Executive summary first, bullets not paragraphs, asks good questions." Test on screen. "Now you try Test 2 or Test 3. Raise your hand if it's working."

## Backup Slides (If Demo Fails)

### If GPT Editor is Down:
1. **Backup:** Show pre-built GPT in action
2. **Alternative:** Walk through instructions verbally
3. **Promise:** "Build it after workshop using written guide"
4. **Focus:** Shift to Delegation Playbook discussion

### If Someone Can't Access ChatGPT Plus:
1. Show on screen (they take notes)
2. Pair them with someone who has access
3. Provide written guide for later
4. Focus on strategic value, not just technical build

### If Time Runs Over:
- Skip Q&A, end at 40 minutes
- Direct questions to workshop site resources
- "Email me your questions after"

### If Time Runs Under:
- Do live customization examples
- Show advanced features (web browsing demo)
- Do additional testing with audience prompts
- Deeper dive into Delegation Playbook

Note: PRESENTER: These backup slides are here in case something goes wrong. Always have a Plan B when doing live demos.
