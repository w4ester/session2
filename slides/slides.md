**💰 The Business Case**
- Problem: Repetitive marketing tasks consume 5-10 hours/week
- Solution: AI agents automate drafts, leaving humans for strategy
- ROI: $250-750/week saved (at $50-75/hr) vs $20/month cost

Note: We're solving a real problem. You'll automate a workflow today. Everything is reusable after.

## Understanding Tokenization

**What are tokens?**
- LLMs read text as tokens (~4 characters each)
- Example: "Marketing AI automates tasks" = 8 tokens
- Why it matters: Token limits, speed, and cost

**💰 Real Costs (GPT-4)**
- Input: $0.03 per 1,000 tokens
- Output: $0.06 per 1,000 tokens
- 500-word prompt ≈ 650 tokens = **$0.02 per request**
- Daily agent use (5,000 tokens) = **$0.15/day** or **$4.50/month**

🧩 **[Try the Tokenizer →](https://w4ester.github.io/session2/#tokenization)**

Note: Demo the tokenizer live. Show how different text = different token counts. Efficient prompts = cheaper + faster.

---

## Live Demo: Tokenization Visualizer

**Try it now:**
1. Open [workshop site section 1](https://w4ester.github.io/session2/#tokenization)
2. Paste: "Write a social media post about our new analytics dashboard"
3. Click "Tokenize Text"
4. See token count + unique tokens + cost estimate

**Test examples:**
- Short text vs long prompt
- With emoji (uses MORE tokens)
- Technical/code snippets

**Why this matters:**
- Longer prompts = higher costs
- Token limits on models (e.g., 8K, 128K)

Note: Give 2 minutes to explore. Walk through examples. Point out emoji uses 3-4 tokens per character.

## 4 Principles of Prompt Engineering

**❌ Basic (costs $0.02, wastes time):**
```
Write a social media post about our new product.
```

**✅ Engineered (costs $0.03, saves 30 minutes):**
```
Write a LinkedIn post announcing our AI-powered
marketing analytics dashboard.

Target: Marketing managers at B2B companies
Benefit: Saves 5+ hours/week on reporting
Tone: Professional but approachable
Length: 150 words
Include: 1 metric, 1 question, 3 hashtags
CTA: "Book a demo"
```

**The 4 Principles:**
1. **Be specific** — format, tone, length, audience
2. **Provide context** — background, constraints
3. **Use examples** — show desired output
4. **Break it down** — guide the reasoning

Note: Run both prompts live in ChatGPT. Show the dramatic difference. Better prompt = better output = less revisions.

---

## Live Activity: Improve Your Prompts

**🧩 [Prompt Quality Checker →](https://w4ester.github.io/session2/#prompting)**

**Your Task (5 minutes):**
1. Go to section 2 on workshop site
2. Improve this prompt:
   ```
   Write an email promoting our analytics dashboard.
   ```
3. Add: audience, benefit, CTA, tone, length
4. Click "Score My Prompt" — aim for 8/10 or higher
5. Copy your result to use later

**What to add:**
- 🎯 Who is this for?
- 💡 What's the key benefit?
- 📞 What action should they take?
- 🎨 What's the tone?
- 📏 How long should it be?

Note: Give 5 minutes. Walk around. Share 2-3 examples after. Point out what made them score high.

---

## Why Templates Matter

**Problem:**
- Every campaign starts from scratch
- Inconsistent quality across team
- Experienced marketers spend time on repetitive tasks

**Solution: Reusable Prompt Templates**
- Variables: `{product_name}`, `{audience}`, `{benefit}`
- Instructions: What the AI should do
- Structure: Format rules
- Examples: Show quality standards

**💰 Template ROI:**
- Build once: 30 minutes
- Use 50 times: Save 25 hours
- Team of 5: Save 125 hours = **$6,250-9,375 saved**
- Cost: $0 (reusable prompt)

Note: Templates are your scaling strategy. One person builds, whole team benefits.

---

## Live Build: Template Generator

**🧩 [Template Generator →](https://w4ester.github.io/session2/#templates)**

**Build a template (5-8 minutes):**
1. Go to section 3 on workshop site
2. **NEW: Try Quick Start presets** (Email, Social, Ad Copy, Blog)
3. Or start from scratch with **autocomplete suggestions**:
   - Task name: Type "Email..." to see 12 suggestions
   - Variables: See 5 common variable combinations
   - Instructions: Customize for your needs
4. Click "Generate Template"
5. Download .md file

**Example templates to build:**
- Email subject lines (preset available!)
- Social media posts (preset available!)
- Ad copy (preset available!)
- Blog outlines (preset available!)

Note: Presets save time! Click one, customize if needed, generate. Save the template — you'll use it forever.

## Build a Custom GPT: Campaign Brief Generator

**Why Campaign Brief Generator?**
- Saves 1-2 hours per brief → 5 minutes
- 4-8 briefs/month = **5-10 hours saved monthly**
- **Annual savings: $4,500-9,000** (@$75/hr)
- Cost: ChatGPT Plus **$240/year**

**What is a Custom GPT?**
- Your own AI assistant that knows your business
- Upload brand guidelines, past briefs, messaging docs
- Custom instructions for consistent output
- Shareable with your team

**💡 Perfect First AI Project:**
- Everyone writes campaign briefs

## Custom GPT vs Agent: What's the Difference?

| Feature | Custom GPT | Agent |
|---------|------------|-------|
| **Knowledge** | ✅ Your docs | ✅ Your docs |
| **Instructions** | ✅ Custom | ✅ Custom |
| **Web Browsing** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Data Analysis** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Multi-step Tasks** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **API Integrations** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

**When to Upgrade GPT → Agent:**
- ✅ Need to research competitors (web browsing)
- ✅ Need to analyze campaign data (CSV uploads)
- ✅ Need multi-step workflows (research → analyze → generate)
- ✅ Need API integrations (CRM, analytics tools)

**💰 Cost Comparison:**
- Custom GPT: **$20/month** (ChatGPT Plus)
- Agent: **$20/month** (same subscription!)
- ROI: **Same price, more capabilities**

**💡 Recommendation:**
Start with Custom GPT → Prove value → Upgrade to Agent when you need tools

Note: You already built the Custom GPT. Now let's add tools to make it an agent.

## Hands-On: Build Campaign Brief Agent

**🧩 [OpenAI Agents →](https://platform.openai.com/agents)**

**Enhance your Custom GPT with tools (10 minutes):**

**Step 1:** Go to OpenAI Agents (requires Plus)
- Click "Create Agent" or import your Custom GPT
- Name: "Campaign Brief Agent"

**Step 2:** Use same instructions from your Custom GPT
- Copy/paste your Campaign Brief Generator instructions

**Step 3:** **Enable Tools** (this is the magic!)
- ✅ **Web Browsing** → "Research competitor campaigns automatically"
- ✅ **Data Analysis** → "Upload past campaign CSVs, analyze what worked"
- ✅ **Memory** → "Remember brand preferences across sessions"

**Step 4:** Test with 3 examples

**Example 1: Basic Brief**
```
Create a campaign brief for a summer sale
targeting existing customers
```

**Example 2: With Research**
```
Create a brief for Q2 product launch.
First, research what competitors did in their
recent launches, then create the brief with insights.
```

**Example 3: With Data**
```
Here's our Q1 campaign performance CSV.
Analyze what worked best, then create a Q2
brief using those insights.
[Upload CSV]
```

Note: Watch the agent use tools! It will browse web, analyze data, THEN generate the brief. This is the power of agents vs GPTs.
