Hi Team,

Quick heads-up for tomorrow's session! We're doing a **hands-on 40-minute workshop** where everyone builds a LinkedIn Post GPT together.

## Workshop Link:
**https://w4ester.github.io/session2/**

## What We're Building:
A Custom GPT that:
- Writes LinkedIn posts in your voice
- Actually posts to LinkedIn for you
- Takes you from idea to published post in 2 minutes

## What You'll Need:
1. **ChatGPT Plus account** ($20/month) - Required to build GPTs
2. **Laptop** ready to code along
3. **LinkedIn account** (we'll post live during the demo!)

## Session Format:
- **Not a lecture** - this is fully hands-on
- Everyone opens GPT Editor and builds together
- I'll walk through each step, you follow along on your screen
- By the end, you'll have a working LinkedIn GPT

## Pre-Workshop Checklist:
Before the session, please:
- [ ] Verify you have ChatGPT Plus (test: go to [chatgpt.com/gpts/editor](https://chatgpt.com/gpts/editor))
- [ ] Have 2-3 past LinkedIn posts or writing samples ready (optional but helpful)
- [ ] Dual monitors recommended (slides on one, GPT Editor on the other)

## Workshop Materials:
Everything is at: **https://w4ester.github.io/session2/**
- Interactive slides with copy/paste templates
- Step-by-step setup guide
- Three pre-built templates (CEO, Marketing, AI Enthusiast)

## Backup Plan:
Don't have ChatGPT Plus yet? No problem!
- Take detailed notes during the workshop
- All materials are available after the session
- Build your GPT on your own time with the guide
